Data Types in Java:

Primitive Types:
    boolean - default = 0 - 1bits - range = true or false
    char - default = `\u0000` - 16 bits - range = ‘\u0000’ (0) to ‘\uffff’ (65535)
    byte - default = 0 - 8bits - range = -128 to 127
    short - default = 0 - 16bits - range = -32768 to 32767
    int - default = 0 - 32bits - range = -2^31 to 2^31-1
    long - default = 0 - 64bits - range = -2^63 to 2^63-1
    float - default = 0.0 - 32bits - range upto 7 decimal digits
    double - default = 0.0 - 64bits - range upto 16 decimal digits\

Non-Primitive Types:
    Array,Strings,Class,Object,Interface

Types of variables:
    Local Variable : its is available locally to the function
    Instance Variable : instance variables represents the instance of the class and it is declared with class name
    Static Variables : static variables are also know as class variables its values does not change on instance
                        its is declared with static keyword
                        Unlike instance variables, we can only have one copy of a static variable per class, irrespective of how many objects we create.
                        if created inside a class, accessible using class variable
