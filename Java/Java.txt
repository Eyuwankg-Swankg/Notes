Data Types in Java:

Primitive Types:
    boolean - default = 0 - 1bits - range = true or false
    char - default = `\u0000` - 16 bits - range = ‘\u0000’ (0) to ‘\uffff’ (65535)
    byte - default = 0 - 8bits - range = -128 to 127
    short - default = 0 - 16bits - range = -32768 to 32767
    int - default = 0 - 32bits - range = -2^31 to 2^31-1
    long - default = 0 - 64bits - range = -2^63 to 2^63-1
    float - default = 0.0 - 32bits - range upto 7 decimal digits
    double - default = 0.0 - 64bits - range upto 16 decimal digits\

Non-Primitive Types:
    Array,Strings,Class,Object,Interface

Operators and Precedance:

Types of variables:
    Local Variable : its is available locally to the function
    Instance Variable : instance variables represents the instance of the class and it is declared with class name
    Static Variables : static variables are also know as class variables its values does not change on instance
                        its is declared with static keyword
                        Unlike instance variables, we can only have one copy of a static variable per class, irrespective of how many objects we create.
                        if created inside a class, accessible using class variable

Wrapper Classes:
    A Wrapper class is a class whose object wraps or contains primitive data types.
    When we create an object to a wrapper class, it contains a field and in this field, we can store primitive data types.
    Wrapper class in java provides the mechanism to convert primitive data type into object is called boxing and object into primitive data type is called unboxing.
    Data structures in the Collection framework, such as ArrayList and Vector, store only objects (reference types) and not primitive types.
    An object is needed to support synchronization in multithreading.

    available in java.lang

    Primitive Type  Wrapper class
    boolean         Boolean
    char            Character
    byte            Byte
    short           Short
    int             Integer
    long            Long
    float           Float
    double          Double
    import java.lang.*;
    class test {
        public static void main(String[] args){
            // Same for all other primitive data types
            int a=20;
            Integer k=Integer.valueof(a);//converting int into Integer 
            Integer j=a;//autoboxing, now compiler will write Integer.valueOf(a) internally 

            //Converting Integer to int   
            Integer b=new Integer(3);   
            int p=b.intValue();//unboxing i.e converting Integer to int 
            int q=a;//auto unboxing, now compiler will write a.intValue() internally   
        }
    }


Strings 
    String literal method:
    when static allocated -> String s="geeks";
    Whenever a String Object is created as a literal, the object will 
    be created in the String constant pool. This allows JVM to optimize the initialization of String literal.

    using 'new' keyword method:
    when dynamically allocated -> String s=new String("geeks");
    JVM will create a new string object in normal (non pool) heap memory and the literal “Welcome” will be 
    placed in the string constant pool. The variable s will refer to the object in heap (non pool).

    It is preferred to use String literals as it allows JVM to optimize memory allocation.
    Strings are immutable
    String s="Sachin"; 
    s.concat(" Tendulkar"); // will not concat as strings are immutable
    s=s.concat(" Tendulkar");  // allocate to new string object as strings are immutable
    
String Methods 
        String s = "hello";
        System.out.println(s.charAt(0)); // gets the char at specified position
        // if s1 > s2, it returns positive number
        // if s1 < s2, it returns negative number
        // if s1 == s2, it returns 0
        System.out.println(s.compareTo("world!"));
        // concating strings
        // strings are immutable so we have to assign it
        s = s.concat(" World");
        System.out.println(s);

        // contains
        System.out.println(s.contains(" Wor"));

        // endsWith
        System.out.println(s.endsWith("!"));

        // startsWith
        System.out.println(s.startsWith("h"));

        // equals
        // return true if equals otherwise false
        System.out.println(s.equals("hello World"));

        // equalsIgnoreCase
        // same as equals but ignores cases
        System.out.println(s.equalsIgnoreCase("Hello World"));

        // String Format
        String sformat = String.format("%d is my age", 21);
        System.out.println(sformat);

        // Get Bytes
        String s1 = "ABCDEFG";
        byte[] barr = s1.getBytes();
        for (int i = 0; i < barr.length; i++) {
            System.out.println(barr[i]);
        }

        // Get Chars
        String str = "ABCDEFG";
        char[] ch = new char[10];
        try {
            str.getChars(1, 4, ch, 0);
            System.out.println(ch);
        } catch (Exception ex) {
            System.out.println(ex);
        }

        // indexOf
        // -1 if not found
        String sindex = "Hello world! hi";
        System.out.println(sindex.indexOf("! "));

        // isEmpty
        String sempty = "";
        System.out.println(sempty.isEmpty());

        // Join String using delimtter
        String joinString1 = String.join("-", "welcome", "to", "javatpoint");
        System.out.println(joinString1);

        // lastIndexOf
        String slastindex = "he!l!l!o";
        System.out.println(slastindex.lastIndexOf('!'));

        // replace
        String sreplace = "hello hi world hi world";
        sreplace = sreplace.replace("hi", "bye");
        System.out.println(sreplace);

        // replaceAll
        // in replaceAll we can use regex expression
        String sreplaceall = "eyuwankg123karthik123!chennai";
        sreplaceall = sreplaceall.replaceAll("\\d{2}!", "to");
        System.out.println(sreplaceall);

        // split
        // accepts regex expression
        String ssplit = "java string split method by javatpoint";
        System.out.println(ssplit);
        String[] words = ssplit.split("\\s");// splits the string based on whitespace
        // using java foreach loop to print elements of string array
        for (String w : words) {
            System.out.println(w);
        }

        //substring
        String text="hello world!";
        System.out.println(text.substring(0,7));

        //toCharArray
        char scharArray[]="hello".toCharArray();

        //toUpperCase and toLowerCase
        System.out.println(text);
        text=text.toUpperCase();
        System.out.println(text);
        text=text.toLowerCase();
        System.out.println(text);

        //trim
        text="     hello world     !";
        System.out.println(text);   
        text=text.trim();
        System.out.println(text);   


String Buffer
    StringBuffer class in java is same as String class except it is mutable
    import java.lang.*;
    class test {
        public static void main(String[] args){
            StringBuffer sb=new StringBuffer("hello");
            System.out.println(sb); //hello
            sb.append("world!"); 
            System.out.println(sb); // helloworld!
            sb.insert(1,"italy"); // insert from position 1
            System.out.println(sb); //hitalyelloworld!
            sb.replace(0,1,"france"); // insert from position 1
            System.out.println(sb); // franceitalyelloworld!
            sb.delete(11,sb.length());  // delete from position 11 to end of string
            System.out.println(sb);  // franceitaly
            sb.reverse();  // will reverse the string
            System.out.println(sb);  // ylatiecnarf
        }
    }

String Builder 
    StringBuilder in Java represents a mutable sequence of characters.
    The StringBuilder class differs from the StringBuffer class on the basis of synchronization
    StringBuilder class provides no guarantee of synchronization whereas the StringBuffer class does.
    faster in single thread

Arrays
    types of declarations:
        int[] array;
        int array[];
    initialization:
        int[] array=new int[20];

    for(int i=0;i<array.length;i++)
        System.out.println(array[i]);

    2D Arrays:
        int array[][] = new int[][];
        int arr[][] = { { 2, 7, 9 }, { 3, 6, 1 }, { 7, 4, 2 } };

    passing array as an argument:
        static void getArray(int arr[]);
        getArray(array);

    returning array:
        static int[] returnArray(){
            return int[];
        }
        int arr[]=returnArray();

    Array Cloning
        int arr[]={1,2,3};
        int array[]=arr.clone()
        cloning of single dimension array creates a deep copy
        cloning of multi dimension array creates a shallow copy

            int array[]={1,2,3,4,5};
        System.out.println(Arrays.asList(array)); // [[I@15db9742]
        
        Arrays.sort(array); // sort the array

        System.out.println(Arrays.binarySearch(array, 0,3,2)); // search the element and returns index

        int arr[]=Arrays.copyOf(array, 10);
        // copyRangeOf(array,startIndex,endIndex)
        for(int i=0;i<arr.length;i++)
            System.out.print(arr[i]+" "); //1 2 3 4 5 0 0 0 0 0 
            System.out.println();

        int ak[] = new int[20];
        Arrays.fill(ak, 20);
        for(int i=0;i<ak.length;i++)
            System.out.print(ak[i]+" "); //1 2 3 4 5 0 0 0 0 0 
        System.out.println();

        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(arr));
OOPS:
    Class and Objects 
    Class is blueprint or a protype 
    Object is a instance of a class
    Method and method passing 
    A method is a collection of statements that perform some specific task and return the result to the caller
    Message passing 
        it is a communication between threads
        like producer-consumer thread problem 
    4 pillars of OOPS:
        Abstraction
            Abstraction is the property by virtue of which only the essential details are displayed to the user.
            The trivial or non-essential units are not displayed to the user.
            In Java, abstraction is achieved by interfaces and abstract classes.
            Types : 
                Data Abstraction
                    hidiing unnesseary details and showing only what is essential
                Control Abstraction
                    software part of abstraction wherein the program is simplified and 
                    unnecessary execution details are removed.
            Abstract Classes 
                An abstract class is a class that is declared with an abstract keyword.
                An abstract method is a method that is declared without implementation.
                An abstract class may or may not have all abstract methods. Some of them can be concrete methods
                A method-defined abstract must always be redefined in the subclass, thus making overriding compulsory 
                or making the subclass itself abstract.
                Any class that contains one or more abstract methods must also be declared with an abstract keyword.
                There can be no object of an abstract class. That is, an abstract class can not be directly instantiated 
                with the new operator.
                An abstract class can have parameterized constructors and the default constructor is always present 
                in an abstract class.
                Child class should provide implementation to all methods 
                there can be final methods in abstract class but abstract class can't be final

                abstract class Car{
                    String Engine;
                    int CC;
                    abstract void getSpec();
                }

                // should provide implementation for all methods
                class Main() extends Car{
                    void getSpec(){

                    }
                }
                
        Encapsulation
            It is defined as the wrapping up of data under a single unit.
            encapsulation is that it is a protective shield that prevents the data from being accessed by the code outside this shield
            Encapsulation can be achieved by declaring all the variables in a class 
            as private and writing public getter and setter methods to get and set values of the variables.

            class demo{
                private key;
                public void setKey(int key){
                    this.key=key;
                }
                public void getKey(int key){
                    return this.key
                }
            }
            Here, the key is a private varibale and only accessible inside the class it declared 
            and the public getter and setter methods are used to set and get values of the key variable 
            
        Inheritance
            It is a method which allows to inherit the features of another class
            It allows reusability of code 
            SuperClass: The class whose features are inherited
            SubClass: The class that inherits the other class

            class derived-class extends base-class  
            {  
            //methods and fields  
            }  

            Types of Inheritance 
                Single Inheritance
                    subclasses inherit the features of one superclass.
                Multilevel Inheritance
                    a derived class will be inheriting a base class and as well as the derived class 
                    also act as the base class to other class. 
                Hierarchial Inheritance
                    In Hierarchical Inheritance, one class serves as a superclass (base class) for
                    more than one subclass
                Multiple Inheritance
                    one class can have more than one superclass and inherit features from all parent classes.
                    Java does not support multiple inheritances with classes.
                    In java, we can achieve multiple inheritances only through Interfaces.

            
        Polymorphism
            It is the ability define same method in different way
            Types:
                Compile-time Polymorphism
                    Method overloading
                    Constructor Overloading 
                Runtime Polymorphism
                    Method overriding
            Method overloading
                same method name but different return type,no of argument,order of arguments
            Constructor Overloading 
                Same Constructor name but with different paramters,order of parameters
            Method overriding
                having same name,arguments,return type of the parent class method 
                private methods,static,final,costructors cannot be overridden
                using keyword 'super.methodname()' we can call the parent method inside the overridden methods in child class


AccessModifiers:
    Public: Accessible in all classes in your application
    Protected:  Accessible within the package,and accessible through child class outside package,
                If there is no child class it cannot be accessed outside the class
    Private:  Accessible only within the class in which it is defined.cannot be accessed from outside the class.
    default: Accessible within the same package cannot be accessed outside the package if no access modifier specified.
    https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/cdn-uploads/Access-Modifiers-in-Java.png

Constructors:  
    A constructor in Java is a special method that is used to initialize objects. The constructor is called 
    when an object of a class is created. It can be used to set initial values for object attributes. 
    Constructors dosent have return type 
    Constructor have same name as class name
    It is called only once at the time of object creation

    class Const{
        // constructor
        Const(){}
    }

    'super()' is used to call the parent class constructor while inherited

    Copy Constructor 
        it is a constructor overloading type where we create a constructor with the parameter as object of that class 
        some times we need a new object with same values another object, we can use this copy constructor to automaticaly copy 
        all the values declared for the object to new object
        class Copy{

            Copy(int a,int b){

            }

            Copy(Copy c){

            }
        }
        class Main{
            public static void main(){
                // Insted of passing these values again we can use the copy constructor to create a new 
                // object with these values
                // calling the original constructor
                Copy copy = new Copy(10,20);

                // calling the copy constructor with the copy object 
                Copy c1 = new Copy(copy);
                
                // this dosent call copy constructor
                // this is just assigning the reference of 'copy' object to 'c2' object
                Copy c2=copy;
            }
        }

    Constructor Chaining
        it is a process of calling one constructor inside a another constructor of the same class 
        to avoid duplicates codes and divide the task among constructors
        Within same class: It can be done using this() keyword for constructors in the same class
        From base class: by using super() keyword to call the constructor from the base class.
        This process is used when we want to perform multiple tasks in a single constructor rather than 
        creating a code for each task in a single constructor we create a separate constructor for each 
        task and make their chain which makes the program more readable. 
        The this() expression should always be the first line of the constructor.
        There should be at-least be one constructor without the this() keyword.
        Constructor chaining can be achieved in any order.

Methods:
    Static Methods:
        Static methods are the methods in Java that can be called without creating an object of class. 
        They are referenced by the class name itself or reference to the Object of that class.  
        When you have code that can be shared across all instances of the same class, put that portion of code into static method.
        They are basically used to access static field(s) of the class.
    Abstract Methods:
        Abstarct methods are just declarations of methods with return type parameters.
        Any class that contains one or more abstract methods must also be declared abstract.
        
        abstract class Abstract {
            abstract void method1();
            void method2(){
                System.out.println("Hello Method2");
            }
        }

        class Base extends Abstarct{
            void method1(){
                System.out.println("Hello Method1");
            }
        }

        class Main{
            void main(){
                Base b=new Base();
                b.method1(); // Hello Method1
                b.method2(); // Hello Method2
            }
        }

Interface: 
    an abstract type used to specify the behavior of a class. An interface in Java is a blueprint of a class.
    There can be only abstract methods in the Java interface, not the method body.
    It is used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in Java.
    We can’t create an instance(interface can’t be instantiated) 
    A class can implement more than one interface.
    An interface can extend to another interface or interface (more than one interface).
    A class that implements the interface must implement all the methods in the interface.
    All the methods are public and abstract. And all the fields are public, static, and final.
    It is used to achieve multiple inheritances.

    interface Player
    {
        final int id = 10;
        int move();
    }

    same method name in 2 interface

    assigning values to varibales

Final Variable:
    it is a non-access modifier applicable only to variable,method,class 
    final variable -> to create a constant variable 
    final method -> to prevent method overriding
    final class -> to prevent inheritance of the class 

    value of a final varibale cannot be changed 
    but for objects they are final reference variable to objects
    so we can change the internal state of object reference

        final StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("Geeks");

        System.out.println(sb);//Geeks

        // changing internal state of object reference by
        //  final reference variable sb
        sb.append("ForGeeks");

        // Again printing the element in StringBuilder
        // object after appending above element in it
        System.out.println(sb); //GeeksForGeeks

    We must initialize a final variable, otherwise, the compiler will throw a compile-time error. 
    A final variable can only be initialized once, either via an initializer or an assignment statement

    You can initialize a final variable when it is declared. This approach is the most common. 
    final int a=10;

    A final variable is called a blank final variable if it is not initialized while declaration. 
    final int a;//blank final variable 

    A blank final variable can be initialized inside an instance-initializer block or inside the constructor. 
    If you have more than one constructor in your class then it must be initialized in all of them
    class Test{
        final int a;
        Test(){
            this.a=10;
        }
    }

Final Classes:
    When a class is declared with final keyword, it is called a final class. A final class cannot be extended(inherited). 

    One is definitely to prevent inheritance, as final classes cannot be extended. For example, all Wrapper Classes like Integer, Float, etc. are final classes. We can not extend them.

    The other use of final with classes is to create an immutable class like the predefined String class. One can not make a class immutable without making it final.

Final Method:
    When a method is declared with final keyword, it is called a final method. A final method cannot be overridden. 


Static Keyword:
    static is applicable to variable,method,class
    we can declare a static block which gets executed only once when the class loads.
    class 
    class Test{
        int a;
        static{
            a=10;
        }
    }
    Static Variables:
        when a variable is declared static only one copy of it is shared among objects and it can be called using the class name 
        class Test{
            static int a=10;
        }
        class Main{
            public static void main(){
                Test.a // applicable
                Test test = Test();
                test.a // not applicable, gives error 
            }
        }
    Static Methods:
        Any static member can be accessed before any objects of its class are created, and without reference to any object
        They can only directly call other static methods.
        They can only directly access static data.
        They cannot refer to this or super in any way.
        class Test{
            static void print(){
                System.out.print("Hello Static Method");
            }
        }
        class Main{
            public static void main(){
                Test.print() // applicable
                Test test = Test();
                test.print // not applicable, gives error 
            }
        }
    Static Class:
        class can be declared static when it is nested inside another class or it is a nestsed class 
        Nested static class doesn’t need a reference of Outer class. In this case, a static class cannot access non-static members of the Outer class. 
        A static nested class may be instantiated without instantiating its outer class.
        Inner classes can access both static and non-static members of the outer class. A static class can access only the static members of the outer class.

        class Copy {
            
            static class Test{
                static int a=10;
            }
        }

        class test {
            public static void main(String[] args) {

                Copy.Test obj=new Copy.Test();
                System.out.println(Copy.Test.a); // applicable
                System.out.println(obj.a); // applicable
            }
        }

Enums:
    Enumerations serve the purpose of representing a group of named constants in a programming language.

    Enums are used when we know all possible values at compile time, such as choices on a menu, rounding modes, command-line flags, 

    A Java enumeration is a class type. Although we don’t need need to instantiate an enum using new, 
    it has the same capabilities as other classes. This fact makes Java enumeration a very powerful tool. 
    Just like classes, you can give them constructor, add instance variables and methods, and even implement interfaces.

    Enum declaration can be done outside a Class or inside a Class but not inside a Method.

    public class Test {
        enum Color {
            RED,
            GREEN,
            BLUE;
        }
    
        // Driver method
        public static void main(String[] args)
        {
            Color c1 = Color.RED;
            System.out.println(c1);
        }
    }

Transient:
    transient is a variables modifier used in serialization. At the time of serialization,
     if we don’t want to save value of a particular variable in a file, then we use transient keyword. 
     When JVM comes across transient keyword, it ignores original value of the variable and save default value of that variable data type.

    transient keyword plays an important role to meet security constraints. 

    There are various real-life examples where we don’t want to save private data in file.
     Another use of transient keyword is not to serialize the variable whose value can be calculated/derived 
     using other serialized objects or system such as age of a person, current date, etc.

    Practically we serialized only those fields which represent a state of instance, after all serialization is
     all about to save state of an object to a file. It is good habit to use transient keyword with private 
     confidential fields of a class during serialization.

    // A sample class that uses transient keyword to
    // skip their serialization.
    class Test implements Serializable
    {
        // Making password transient for security
        private transient String password;
    
        // Making age transient as age is auto-
        // computable from DOB and current date.
        transient int age;
    
        // serialize other fields
        private String username, email;
        Date dob;
    
        // other code
    }

Singletone Class
    a class is said to be singleton if it limits the number of objects of that class to one.
    We can’t have more than a single object for such classes.
    Singleton classes are employed extensively in concepts like Networking and Database Connectivity.
    The constructor of singleton class would be private so there must be another way to get the instance of that class.
    Singleton class can have only one object which can be used 
    its object can be created inside the class only 
    we have to create a static method which can be called using the class name
    which returs the instace or object of that singleton class

    class Singletone{
        static Singletone instance=null;
        private Singletone(){

        }
        static public Singletone getInstace(){
            if(instance==null)
                instance=new Singletone();
            return instance;
        }
    }
    class Main{
        public static void main(String args[])    
        {    
            // we can call the instance static method inside the class and get the object instace of the class
            MySingleton a = MySingleton.getInstance();
        }
    }

Nested Class:   
    It is a class that is declared inside another class or interface 
    it can access all members of the outer class including private members and methods 
    
    while accessing outer class memebers we dont need instance 
     since the object of inner class or nested class is created using instance of outer class 
     it will get value of outer class variables from that instace

    ways of creating object for nested class:
        // first create object for outer class
        Outer outer = new Outer("Tata");
        // using outer class object to create a new instace of nested class
        Outer.Nested nested = outer.new Nested();

        // declare directly inner class object 
        Outer.Nested nested = new Outer("Mahindra).new Nested();

    class Outer{
        private brand;
        Outer(String brand){
            this.brand=brand;
        }
        class Nested{
            // we dont have to specify instace using this 
            // it will get instace reference while creating object
            public String display(){
                return brand;
            }
        }
    }

    class Main{
        static void main(){
            Outer outer = new Outer("Tata");
            // using outer class object to create a new instace of nested class
            Outer.Nested nested = outer.new Nested();
        }    
    }

Throwable Class:
    Throwable class is the super class of all error and Exception in java
